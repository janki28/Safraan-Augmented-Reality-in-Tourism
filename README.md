# Safraan-Augmented-Reality-in-Tourism
SAFRAAN consists of a set of software services that act on mobile distributed hardware and can communicate via wireless networks. This communication allows to carry personalized mobile devices with embedded services, while intelligent environments provide location based services. The services discover each other and dynamically cooperate to provide desired functionality. This study uses Wikitude SDK modeling to create a three-dimensional model of the scene and to detect and track the functions. Interactions between virtual buttons and virtual reality can also be created as virtual buttons. The AR application in the Wikitude SDK is a hub that connects the virtual world with reality.
